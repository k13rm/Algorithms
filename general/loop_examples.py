# Type 1: for i in range(n): [0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1], increases by 1 every time
# Type 2: for i in range(a,b): the for loop starts at a, ends at b-1, increases by 1 every time. So the total number or rounds is (b - a)
# Type 3: for i in range(a,b,c):

# Exercise: print all the odd numbers between 33 and 200

#### While Loop
# booleans are variables that can be either True or False, and are often used on if-statements

# a = 10
# b = 20

# while a < b:
#     print("Hello World")
#     # do something
#     b = b - 2

# an Infinite Loop

# n = 10
# for i in range(n):
#     print(i)

# i = 0
# while i < n:
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 1

# i = 0

# for i in range(20):
#     print(i)


# while i < 20:
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 1

# i = 5

# for i in range(5, 20):
#     print(i)

# while i < 20:
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 1


# for i in range(10, 50, 5):
#     print(i)

# i = 10

# while i < 50:
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 5

# Exercise: Use a for loop or a while loop to print the numbers from 20 to 5 backwards

# k = 20

# while k > 5:
#     print(k)
#     k = k-1

# for k in range(20, 5, -1):

# Arithmetic series, that initial = 3, base of 7, print all numbers in this series up to 61
